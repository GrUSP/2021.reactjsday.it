        talk_title: "Flutter for React and React Native developers"
        talk_description: "After working quite a long time in tech, especially as an architect, I understood that it's not good to be tied to a single framework for a long-time. You might have heard about the technical breadth term! If not, it means you should know what you don't know. It helps you broaden your knowledge, sharpen your skills, and ultimately make a better decision or even have a better career or life.
          In this session, I will onboard you to Flutter and its ecosystem, where you can start developing the next application right away. You'll learn Flutter based on what you already know. If you have been a React or RN developer, this talk will facilitate and speed up your learning process and help you add another skill to your resume."

        talk_title: "Stealth-mode North Star! Rebranding in secret with feature flags"
        talk_description: "Great products combine valuable features with strong branding to a target audience. Defining your brand's North Star is the key to delivering the standards of that promise to your customers in a compelling â€” and memorable way.
          Occasionally though, your visual brand is redefined and you need to course-correct your UI to align with a new direction, while the rest of your team is meeting their own product goals. However! What if details of the rebrand are not widely shared within your organization? How do you get that rebrand in without sharing the details until it's time?
          In this talk, we'll take a look at how you can use feature flags to roll out an updated UI in stealth mode â€” without impacting the work or velocity of your fellow teammates."
